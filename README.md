# WeatherApp
A simple weather app harnessing darksky API.

The app has three core components:

The main HTML file called index.html, a JavaScript (Jquery) page called scripts.js and a CSS page called stylesheet.css within the css folder.

All other content is made by third parties and are plugins, or css icons.


To use: 

open the index.html file in any browser, note that support cannot be guaranteed for IE.

On the interface there should be weather for London currently. There is also a combobox in the top left, in this there are abbreivations for all countries around the world.

For example GB for Great Britian or IE for Ireland.
Once a country has been selected a second drop down should appear. This will list all the cities in that country. 
On selecting a city the dashboard will refresh with details of the selected city.

Changing the country will cause the list of cities to reset.

There is also a refresh button to the right side of "Todays weather".

Example uses include:

Country:  IE
City:     Skibbereen

Country:  GB
City:     Newcastle Upon Tyne
